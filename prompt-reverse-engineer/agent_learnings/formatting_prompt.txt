### Formatting Characteristics Analysis

1. **Paragraph Structure:**
   - The text is structured into multiple paragraphs that convey specific ideas or points regarding fees and charges. Each paragraph is relatively short, typically focusing on a single aspect to enhance readability and comprehension.

2. **Use of Whitespace:**
   - Adequate whitespace is used throughout the document. This includes spacing between headings, paragraphs, and list items, which separates different sections clearly and prevents the text from appearing cluttered.

3. **Heading Hierarchy:**
   - A clear heading hierarchy is established with various heading levels, indicated by styles such as "##" for major sections and "###" for subsections. This hierarchy helps the reader easily navigate through the document and identify the structure. 
   - Example of hierarchy:
     - `# Fees and charges`
     - `## Fees at a glance`
     - `### Service fee`
     - `### Dealing fees`

4. **List Formatting:**
   - Both ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists are used for clarity, especially to outline fees and charges. 
   - Items within lists are bolded to emphasize key information, such as "Service fees" or categories of investments.

5. **Text Emphasis Patterns:**
   - Key phrases and important pieces of information are emphasized using bold formatting. For example, percentages, fees, and essential notes are frequently highlighted.
   - Italics and links are used to reference documents and further reading, which adds interactivity and directs the reader to related resources.

6. **Overall Document Organization:**
   - The document follows a logical flow, starting with general information on fees and charges, moving into specific types of fees, and then providing scenarios/examples for clarity.
   - Important information is often prefaced with "Important information -", drawing attention to potential risks or considerations. 
   - Sections conclude with calls to action or links, guiding the reader towards further steps (e.g., downloading documents or reading more).

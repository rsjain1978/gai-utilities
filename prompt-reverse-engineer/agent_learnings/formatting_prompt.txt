### Formatting Characteristics Analysis

#### Paragraph Structure
- The text is structured in a manner where large blocks of text are broken down into smaller, more manageable paragraphs. This enhances readability and allows for easier digestion of information.
  
#### Use of Whitespace
- There is ample use of whitespace between paragraphs and sections. This separation helps distinguish different sections and categories of information, contributing to the overall readability of the document.
  
#### Heading Hierarchy
- The use of headings is consistent, with a clear hierarchy:
  - Main headings use a large, bold format (#).
  - Subheadings utilize smaller, bold formats (##, ###).
  - This tiered approach allows readers to quickly identify the structure of the document and the relationships between sections.

#### List Formatting
- Bulleted and numbered lists are employed throughout to present information clearly:
  - Numbered lists identify steps or items in a sequence.
  - Bulleted lists present items without implying an order.
- Emphasis is added to specific parts of the lists (like fees) by using bold font.

#### Text Emphasis Patterns
- Key phrases and important information are emphasized through bold formatting, capturing the reader's attention and highlighting critical information quickly.

#### Overall Document Organization
- The document is organized logically, first defining the charges, followed by specific details about each type of fee, examples, and services. Each section flows naturally into the next, making it easy for readers to follow along.
- Tables are used effectively to compare fees, enhancing clarity.

### Emotional Analysis of Text

**1. Strength of Expressions:**
- The text primarily presents factual and informational content. The emotional strength of the expressions is low. Phrases such as "you may get back less than you invest" and "you should speak to one of Fidelity's advisers" imply concern and a cautious approach, but they don't register strong emotions. The language is straightforward and professional, suitable for financial communications, thus exhibiting more emphasis on clarity and transparency.

**2. Emotional Variation:**
- The text has minimal emotional variation. It maintains a steady tone throughout, primarily focused on delivering information rather than evoking feelings. There are few points where emotion could peak—typically around warnings (e.g., the risks of investment)—but overall, this is kept within a professional boundary.

**3. Intensity Peaks and Valleys:**
- Peaks and valleys in emotional intensity are minimal. The text might have slight peaks when discussing potential for loss (the risk factor) and how fees are structured, which relates directly to a reader's financial stakes. However, these peaks do not manifest in overt emotional language but rather in a neutral tone reflecting the serious nature of financial responsibilities.
  
**4. Overall Emotional Arc:**
- The overall emotional arc is largely flat, sustaining a tone of cautious professionalism. It begins with a warning (about possible investment losses) and continues to provide detailed information about fees and services without experiencing strong emotional shifts. The concluding remarks about account choices and various investment options have a somewhat optimistic tone but still remain subdued.

**Final Emotional Summary:**
The text serves its purpose as an informative document for potential investors. While there is a slight hint of concern regarding investments, the dominant emotion conveyed is one of professional reassurance, caution, and clarity. It lacks dramatic emotional shifts and instead embraces a steady, reliable tone suitable for financial discourse.

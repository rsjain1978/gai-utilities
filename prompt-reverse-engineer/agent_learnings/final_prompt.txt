**Unified System Prompt for Generating Financial Documentation**

"Create a comprehensive and structured informational guide on fees and charges related to financial services or investment products. The text should exhibit the following characteristics:

1. **Structure and Organization**:
    - Utilize clear headings and subheadings following a logical hierarchy (e.g., `# Main Title`, `## Section`, `### Subsection`) to facilitate navigation.
    - Incorporate bulleted and numbered lists to present key information succinctly and clearly. Ensure that important terms or figures are bolded for emphasis.

2. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**:
    - Write in a formal, informative tone that is suitable for a general audience with some financial knowledge, aimed at a reading level of grades 10-12. Utilize a mix of long, explanatory sentences alongside shorter, impactful statements to maintain engagement.
    - Aim for approximately 50% lexical density with a balanced distribution of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) while ensuring a vocabulary richness of 25-30%.

3. **Technical Language and Clarity**:
    - Employ specific financial terminology (e.g., "net asset value," "annual fees") and ensure that complex terms are clearly explained to maintain accessibility for readers.
    - Provide examples to illustrate different fee scenarios while avoiding overwhelming jargon.

4. **Emphasis and Important Information**:
    - Highlight crucial information using bolding, italics, or underlining as necessary. Incorporate phrases that indicate important notes or warnings (e.g., "Important information - please keep in mind") to capture the reader's attention regarding critical financial implications.

5. **Readability and Accessibility**:
    - Maintain adequate whitespace between sections, paragraphs, and list items to enhance readability.
    - Keep paragraphs focused and generally short, ensuring each primarily addresses a single idea or concept.

6. **Emotional Tone**:
    - Convey a neutral, factual tone throughout the document. Aim for a low emotional intensity, with slight peaks of reassurance balanced by cautionary advice on financial investments. The text should instill trust in the reader without evoking strong emotional responses.

7. **Engagement and Action**:
    - Incorporate calls to action that encourage reader interaction (e.g., "Download the fee schedule," "Contact us for personalized service") to foster engagement with the service provided.

By adhering to these guidelines, produce a clear, informative, and professional text that effectively communicates the necessary details about financial fees and charges while maintaining user confidence and trust."

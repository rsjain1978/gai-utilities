Fees and charges




# Fees and charges

We calculate your fees based on your total investment value, not per account.

**Important information -** please keep in mind that the value of investments can go down as well up, so you may get back less than you invest. This information is not a personal recommendation for any particular investment. If you are unsure about the suitability of an investment you should speak to one of [Fidelity's advisers](/services/advice/) or an authorised financial adviser of your choice.

### How we collect your fee

When you invest with us, we provide you with a separate account called a Cash Management Account (CMA) to pay your service fees from.\*

- We collect the service fee from your CMA around the 1st of every month.
- There's no fee on your CMA. It's simply there for us to collect your fee instead of collecting money from your investments. This means any tax-wrapped investments you may have, such as an ISA or SIPP, are left to grow.
- For joint accounts, we collect fees directly from cash within your joint investment accounts, as Cash Management Accounts aren’t available for accounts held jointly. For more information on joint accounts, go to page 11 of the [Doing Business with Fidelity document](/media/PI%20UK/pdf/legal/Direct_Key_features_document.pdf)

**\*If there's not enough cash in your CMA, we'll collect fees from cash within your account before selling some of your investments in your other accounts to cover charges.**

## Fees and charges in detail

We want you to have full transparency of our fees so that you have a clear understanding of what to expect when you invest with us. If you want to read more detail about our fees and charges in your own time, please download the

[Doing Business with Fidelity document](/media/PI%20UK/pdf/legal/Direct_Key_features_document.pdf).

[**Our service fee**](#accordion-9a2947b3)

This table shows how fees differ depending on the value of your investment(s). For shares, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and investment trusts, this portion of the fee is capped at **£90 (£7.50 a month)** and we don't charge a service fee for junior accounts or for exchange-traded investments held in an Investment Account, or on cash held in your accounts.

Remember, our service fee applies to the total of all your investments. Our fee also includes our online guidance tools, news and insights from industry experts and our secure, easy-to-use investing platform and app.

| **Total value of investments** | Service fee (annual amount or %) |
| --- | --- |
| Less than £25,000 | 0.35%  - if you have a regular savings plan or £90 (£7.50 a month) if you don't |
| £25,000 or more but less than £250,000 | 0.35% - of the total value of your investments |
| £250,000 or more but less than £1 million | 0.20% - and you will automatically qualify for [Fidelity's Wealth Management Service](/services/wealth/) benefits |
| £1 million+ | 0.20% a year -  for the first £1 million and no service fee for investments over £1 million. This means the maximum fee you will ever pay for all of your personal accounts is £2,000 a year |

The same service fee is charged across all of your investments. So, if you hold £300,000 - the fee would be 0.20% across the full amount.

**What if I want to invest using a financial adviser?**

Charges could be different from the ones you hold directly with us. We suggest you speak with your financial adviser to find out more about what charges and fees will be applied.

[**Investment fees set by companies managing your funds**](#accordion-c0bb7fe2)

Ongoing fund charges are set by the companies who manage the funds and sit outside of our service fee and share dealing fees. The wide choice of funds available have a range of ongoing charges, which start from as low as **0.05%**. And some funds may also have additional fees and charges, including:

- A bid-offer spread, which is effectively a charge applied when you buy or sell
- A performance fee
- A fund manager buy or sell charge

We’ve negotiated discounted ongoing charges on hundreds of funds on our platform. Some discounts are already included in the fund's regular charges, so you pay less automatically. In other cases, the discount will be given as a payment that gets reinvested into the qualifying funds at the end of each quarter. This is called a quarterly rebate.

Any rebates you get in an Investment Account might be subject to income tax at your marginal tax rate. We recommend checking each investment's factsheet for more information, as investment charges can differ between funds.

[View fund discounts](/services/charges-fees/fund-discounts/)

Details of the specific charges can be found on the investment's factsheet or Key Information Document.

[**Cash within your account**](#accordion-d1f54a43)

Cash in your Fidelity accounts is held as ‘cash within your account’. We don't charge service fees on cash within your account or charge for withdrawals. We pay interest on cash balances too.

Please note: we do not charge a service fee for holding cash. We'll retain interest from the bank(s) to enable us to continue to develop our products and services, and to help keep our platform fees low.

## FAQs

[**How do I pay my account fee?**](#accordion-763baafb)

You can top up your Cash Management Account with cash using a debit card, or if there’s no cash in your account we can sell some of your investments to cover it. The fee is payable monthly in arrears and taken on the 1st of the month.

[**What if I don’t have enough money in my account to pay my charges?**](#accordion-a58d0104)

When you pay service fees, they are always taken from your Cash Management Account.

- If you have cash in there, we will take the fees from this cash rather than any tax-wrapped ISA and SIPP investments you may have.
- If you don't have enough cash in your Cash Management Account, we will sell from the account the fee has come from to make up the outstanding balance and transfer that to the Cash Management Account. When we do this, we have a hierarchy and start by selling from cash within your account, then your largest investment by value and by asset class. This means for example we would take the fee from the largest fund before we take it from an exchange-traded fund or investment trust.
- We take your ISA fees first, then SIPP, and finally any Investment Accounts from the Cash Management Account. This gives you the best chance of keeping your ISA and SIPP savings where they are.

Download the [Doing Business with Fidelity document](/media/PI%20UK/pdf/legal/Direct_Key_features_document.pdf) for full details of how this works.

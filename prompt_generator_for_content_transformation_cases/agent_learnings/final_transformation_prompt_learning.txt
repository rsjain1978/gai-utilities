## Objective

- **Sentence Complexity**: Aim to shorten and simplify sentences while preserving the core message.
- **Structural Changes**: Shift from complex structures to straightforward forms emphasizing essential information.
- **Cognitive Load**: Reduce the overall cognitive effort required for comprehension.
- **Comprehension**: Simplify terminology; clarify definitions and ensure they are reader-friendly.
- **Emotional Tone**: Transition from a cautious and formal tone to a positive and empowering tone.

### 2. Grammar and Structure Changes
- **Sentence Length**: Target an average sentence length of 10-15 words. Break longer sentences into shorter, clearer phrases.
- **Voice**: Utilize active voice consistently (e.g., “Fidelity calculates fees” rather than “Fees are calculated by Fidelity”).
- **Reduction of Complexity**: Eliminate subordinate clauses and redundancies. Prioritize clarity in sentence construction.
- **Word Choice**: Favor simple vocabulary and avoid technical jargon. Provide clear, straightforward definitions when necessary.

### 3. Style and Tone Modifications
- **Tone Shift**: Move from a formal, cautious tone to a friendly and supportive tone. Use reassuring phrases like “We offer transparency” instead of “Fees may vary.”
- **Engagement**: Maintain professionalism, but favor informative statements over rhetorical questions or excessive qualifications.
- **Emotionally Empowering Language**: Highlight benefits such as clarity and customer support to foster a positive emotional connection with the reader.

### 4. Formatting Requirements
- **Paragraph Structure**: Integrate related ideas into single, concise paragraphs, retaining clarity.
- **Bullet Points**: Use bullet points for critical information but prefer narrative form for summaries. Ensure important data is presented in a clear manner.
- **Spacing**: Eliminate unnecessary white space to create a cohesive text flow.
- **Highlighting Key Information**: Use bold selectively for essential figures but limit frequent bolding for common phrases.

### 5. Content Density Adjustments
- **Content Word Ratio**: Increase the proportion of content words by focusing on significant concepts and minimizing fillers. Ensure each statement provides valuable information.
- **Information Density**: Streamline detailed explanations into essential summaries. Each point should convey fundamental ideas succinctly.

### 6. Size and Length Transformations

- **Excessive Detail Reduction**: Eliminate redundant phrases and non-critical data while emphasizing vital information clearly.
- **Overall Length**: Ensure the final text is brief yet informative, condensing multiple ideas into core concepts.

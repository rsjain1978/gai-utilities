### 1. Sentence Structure Changes

**Original Sentence Structure:**
- The input text follows a specific structure characterized by noun phrases followed by descriptions or examples, lists of fees, and explanations that often extend over several sentences. For example:
  - "Our service fee is charged for administering your accounts, with flexible options for amounts less than £25,000."

**Transformed Sentence Structure:**
- The output text emphasizes conciseness and precision through simpler, compound sentences that aggregate information. For instance:
  - "Fidelity calculates fees based on your total investment value, offering transparency and flexible options."

**Overall Shift:** 
- The output utilizes more direct and fewer subordinate clauses compared to the input. There is a reduction in elaboration, favoring brevity and clarity.

### 2. Grammar Rule Applications

**Grammar Changes Noted:**
- The transformation involves a shift from passive to active voice, thus applying the rule of subject-verb agreement more directly in the output.
  - **Input Example:** "Fees charged by Fidelity" is made active in the output as "Fidelity calculates fees..."
  
- The output employs fewer instances of complex technical grammar (e.g., lists with additional modifiers). For example, descriptions are consolidated and made straightforward. 

**Descriptive Phrases (Input):** 
  - "Service fees - set by and paid to us for the services we provide..."

**Consolidated (Output):**
  - "Service fees include account administration and investment tools..."

### 3. Tense and Voice Modifications

**Tense Modifications:**
- The original text typically uses present tense consistently for descriptions and factual statements.
- The output preserves the present tense but modifies voice from passive constructions (“Fees charged by Fidelity”) to active voice (“Fidelity calculates fees”).

**Voice Modifications:**
- Active voice in the output provides a more engaging and direct communication style. For example:
  - "Fidelity calculates fees based on..." compared to the passive structure in the original text. 

### 4. Syntactic Pattern Transformations

**Syntactic Patterns:**
- The input text commonly utilizes a complex list structure with bullet points and headers that delineate types of fees and examples.
- The output text simplifies these patterns, converting them into succinct clauses that imply a list format without explicitly listing items, thereby enhancing readability.

**Examples of Syntactic Changes:**
- **Input:** "You can download the Doing Business with Fidelity document for more detail on our fees and charges."
- **Output:** "Fees are collected via a Cash Management Account." 

**Reduction of Length:**
- The transformation reduces the length of sentences significantly while ensuring essential information remains intact.

### Summary 

The transformation from the input to output text illustrates a shift towards a more concise, clear, and active style of writing. It effectively maintains the essential content while significantly changing the sentence structure, applying grammar rules more dynamically, and transforming syntactic patterns for improved readability. The changes enhance user engagement and comprehension, crucial for conveying complex financial information succinctly.

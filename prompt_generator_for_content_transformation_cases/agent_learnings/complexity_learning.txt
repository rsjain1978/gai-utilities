### Analysis of Complexity Transformations

#### 1. Sentence Length Variations
The **input text** contains numerous lengthy sentences, often exceeding 20 words or more. For instance, many sentences describe specific fees, conditions, and examples related to service fees and dealing fees. In contrast, the **output text** significantly reduces the sentence length. It employs concise phrases while maintaining essential information. For example:
- Input: "We calculate your fees based on your total investment value, not per account."
- Output: "Fidelity calculates fees based on your total investment value."

This change results in sentences that are more digestible, typically ranging between 10 to 15 words, allowing for quicker reading and comprehension.

#### 2. Structural Complexity Changes
The **input text** displays structural complexity through various formatting styles (e.g., bullet points, sections, subheadings) that break the content down into multiple layers. It employs lengthy tables and numerous headings which convey detailed information across several pages.

In contrast, the **output text** presents information in a more linear format, prioritizing essential information and summarizing much of the detail into direct statements. The use of bold for key terms adds emphasis without overwhelming the reader with structural elements. This shift simplifies the overall structure by focusing on main points rather than intricate details, creating a more straightforward flow of information.

#### 3. Cognitive Load Modifications
The **input text** presents a high cognitive load due to its comprehensive nature and extensive details on fees, various conditions, and illustrative examples. Readers must navigate through numerous sections, tables, and hyperlinks, which can be overwhelming and demand significant attention.

The **output text**, however, reduces cognitive load through summarization and clarity. It condenses essential information into highlights without losing critical data. By eliminating excess details and focusing on high-level summaries, the output allows readers to grasp main ideas quickly and with less effort.

#### 4. Comprehension Difficulty Shifts
The **input text** requires a higher level of comprehension due to its use of technical jargon, such as specific percentages and fee structures, along with legal disclaimers. This complexity can create barriers for individuals lacking in financial literacy or those unfamiliar with investment terminology.

Conversely, the **output text** enhances comprehension by simplifying language and reducing jargon while still retaining necessary detail. Complex ideas such as service fees and dealing charges are distilled into basic terms and concepts, making them more accessible to a broader audience. This shift likely lowers the comprehension difficulty, enabling readers with varying levels of financial understanding to engage with the content effectively.

### Conclusion
Overall, the transformations from the input to the output text indicate a deliberate effort to streamline information, reduce complexity, and enhance accessibility. These changes contribute to a more reader-friendly format that likely promotes better understanding and engagement with the content.
